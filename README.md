# üìù OpsLevel Take Home Assignment - Todo List App

This is a simple, interactive CLI Todo App written in Python.

It allows you to:
- Add tasks with a priority (lower number = higher priority)
- Delete tasks by ID
- View all current tasks, sorted by priority
- See missing priorities to help assign new tasks

---

Note : test.py is a file meant to test if the functions for TodoApp are working properly. Use main.py as entrypoint for the ClI
```
python main.py
```
